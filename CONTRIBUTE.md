# Contributing

## Reporting bugs and feature requests

You can report bugs and request features on [Sheldon's Main Repository](https://github.com/sheldonldev/sheldonldev.github.io/issues).

## Developing and making pull requests

The [build](/build) directory gets deployed and is made available at the root of the top-level domain.

Examples:

- `/build/ => https://cdn.sheldonl.com/`

- `/build/asset/testbot.jpg => https://cdn.sheldonl.com/asset/testbot.jpg`

Your pull-request should be made to the build directory and should already have pre-compiled, compressed and minified assets as needed.
